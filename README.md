# Robot Parts Installation
This Repository contains 3D Robot parts, which show at the end the final shape of the robotic bodyðŸ¤–after assembling the pieces.

It is the fifth task of the program which is collecting all the parts of the robot with the right size and place, designing eyes holes for the robot, and designing a tablet holder. 

first, classify the parts so the job becomes easier, to at least 3 groups.

second, collecting each group individually.

third, gather the groups with each other, the base then the body next to it the arms, create the neck, and place the last part of the robot, the head.
